        <p class="release">11:30pm, Dec 12, 2025</p>
                <p>Think DVDs are relics of the past? Think again—this blog dives into whether these discs are truly dead or simply fading from mainstream view.</p>

                <p>What used to be a one-time purchase has become an ongoing rental system. You don’t own the movie you watched last night—you borrow it as long as your subscription stays active and the licensing deals don’t change. A film available today might disappear tomorrow due to shifting rights. Even digital “purchases” on Amazon or iTunes can vanish if studios revoke licenses.</p>

                <p>Physical copies, once the bedrock of media ownership, have become an afterthought. DVD and Blu-ray sales keep falling as homes trade disc players for smart TVs. Younger generations often have never purchased a physical movie at all. Why would they, when everything is instantly available online?</p>

                <p>But there’s a trade-off. We’ve gained convenience, portability, and endless choice, but we’ve lost permanence—bonus features, director commentaries, and the certainty that a favorite film will remain available. And ultimately, we’ve lost the feeling of true ownership.</p>
